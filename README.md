# **Oberrō**

**Oberrō** is a communal project in which practitioners from multiple fields and regions can engage and develop collaborative and experimental practices. The name **Oberrō**, which means both “to wander among” and “to err”, carries the founding concepts and structures of the project: a non-physical platform for artistic thinking and making, composed by an ever-changing group of nomadic practitioners with a diverse or at times no topic or practice of focus. The project refutes the establishment of borders, becoming a morphing and erratic initiative which envisions a diverse range of experimental practices, accepting the possibility and potentials of error/failures. 

**Oberrō** is a communal project because we believe that each member of the community can become a host of activities, proposing independently or collectively, other contexts and formats. 


## **Current Projects**

One of the ideas currently in development at **Oberrō** is the process of deconstructing the current structures of art and exhibition-making by applying *communal* culture and ethics to those processes, such as with the implementation of “house labs” and “home exhibitions” (maker-labs and exhibitions which are hosted by one or other people, in their own homes, and which are open to invited guests or open to the public).


## **Activities**

Within its activities, **Oberrō** hosts artist-run residencies, open home labs, exhibitions and develops research and publications.
